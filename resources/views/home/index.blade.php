    <FONT COLOR=Teal>In 2014, we created <B>Govify</B> to help government create documents in government-friendly formats. Today, we're releasing Govify.Cloud, to put those same documents into <B>The Cloud</B>. This enables government agencies to say they're using The Cloud, as a token gesture to fulfilling new IT requirements, without having to change their existing business practices.</FONT>
</P>
<P>
    One of the biggest hurdles for government agencies to embrace <B>Open Data</B> is the ability to produce documents in a government-usable format, but well-formatted data and machine-readable text are not government-friendly formats.
</P>
<P>
    To solve this, we created <B>Govify</B>, a tool which converts machine-friendly text into Government-ready PDFs.
</P>
<P>
    These legible but closed-format documents can be easily used for any government purpose - or even printed, signed, and re-scanned to add extra bureaucracy.
